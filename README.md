# Rails Kickoff â€“ Bootstrap
A rapid Rails 6 application template for personal use. This particular template utilizes bootstrap a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

Bootstrap depends on Webpack so this also comes bundled with [webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) support.

Inspired heavily by [justalever](https://github.com/justalever/kickoff_tailwind). thank you for your repos.

### Included gems

- [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
- [friendly_id](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id)
- [better_errors](https://github.com/BetterErrors/better_errors)
- [name_of_person](https://github.com/basecamp/name_of_person)

### Bootstrap5 CSS by default
With Rails 6 we have webpacker by default now.I prefer bootstrap.
